Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Red Riding Hood. Her name was fitting because of the red hooded cape she always wore.
One day her mother told Little Red to deliver a basket of baked goods to her grandmother, who wasn't feeling well.
Little Red was going to go through the woods so her mother gave her three rules.
 Go straight to Grandma's, spend the night there, and under no circumstances talk to strangers.
 So Little Red set off and for the first hour, everything was fine, until a wolf showed up.
 The wolf was charming and asked her where she was headed, with which she replied,
 "To my Grandmother's, just over the hill".
 The wolf was cunning, so he bid her farewell, and dashed to the grandmother's cottage.
 When she answered, the wolf swallowed her whole, and put on her clothes, and waited Little Red's arrival.
 When Little Red Riding Hood arrived, she opened the door and the wolf (disguised as her grandmother) said
 "Hello my dear, how are you?"
"I'm fine grandmother, but it's you who I should be asking, how are you?", she replied, 
"You look kind of strange..."
"Whatever do you mean dear"
"Well...", she said, "Your eyes are so big".
"All the better to see you with"
"But your ears are so big"
"All the better to hear you with"
"But your nose is so long"
"All the better to smell you and your goodies with"
"But your teeth are so sharp!"
"ALL THE BETTER TO EAT YOU WITH"
Little Red screamed as the wolf gobbled her up whole, and the wolf decided to stay for a nap.
A woodcutter in the nearby woods, heard the scream, ran over, and upon seeing the wolf, cut it open.
The grandmother and Little Red were unharmed because he swallowed them whole and the wolf was no more. 
The end.
